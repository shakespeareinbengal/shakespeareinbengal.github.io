(Interviewed by Dr. Paromita Chakravarti and Sri Abhishek Sarkar)

**When did you pass the B.A. and M.A. examinations? And from which institutions?
 **Dhritikanta Lahiri Chowdhury:** I passed my matriculation exam in 1946 from Mymensingh. ThenI came here and got admission in Presidency College without much trouble. We were a class of five people.

**Sheila Lahiri Chowdhury:** I studied in Lady Amritbai Daga College, Nagpur from where I passedmy B.A. I did not have Honours. I passed my M.A. in 1957 from Calcutta University.

**When did your first encounter with Shakespeare take place (at school or college)?**

**SLC**: In school. We were taughtJulius Caesarvery thoroughly by the nuns in our convent school.

**Which texts were a part of the college and university syllabi?**

**DLC:** Tarak-babu taught usAs You Like Itin the first year of B.A. We hadMacbethas well. We hadonly that one play in the four years of Intermediate and B.A. We did Hamlet during M.A.

**SLC:** We didn’t have any Shakespeare in our undergraduate days. We didHamletat the M.A. level. Ithink we also had Antony and Cleopatra. Subodh-babu taught us that.

**Who taught the texts in question?**

**DLC:** We were taught by TaraknathSen. He was said to be a Miltonic character. I still don’t know inwhat way he was Miltonic. We were taught Hamlet by Subodh Sengupta. Macbeth was taught by Tarapada Mukherjee.

**SLC:** Subodh-babu taught us about the quarto and folio. He was very thorough. After class Tarak-babu used to take special classes. That is when I did Hamlet with him.

**What techniques were used (e.g., close reading, lecture demonstration, group discussion, seminars etc) for teaching Shakespeare?**

**SLC:** Tarak-babu used to do a very close reading. Every word was important to him. He would explainevery comma and period – why it was there. He tried to direct our attention to all the explanations a word could have. Like ‘lie in your lap’ – that Hamlet tells Ophelia – and the various meanings that ‘lie’ can have. He never went into the obscene though! Subodh-babu directed us how to look at sources such as Plutarch or North.

**Did the teacher discuss philology and prosody while reading Shakespeare?
 **DLC:** Tarak-babu used to teach prosody very well.**

**Were students encouraged to think independently and challenge the teacher?**

**DLC:** Tarak-babu did not approve of anyone going up against him. He did not like alternate theoriesto what he preferred.

**Which editions and what critical material were prescribed and used?**

**DLC:** We read the Percival edition ofAs You Like It.He had been the Principal of Presidency College.There couldn’t be any question of reading a different edition. As for critical material we were asked to read A. C. Bradley.

**What was the examination and question pattern like?**

**DLC:** We had long questions like ‘Comment on Shakespeare’s…’ We also had ‘reference to context’questions.

**Did the teacher refer to stage and film productions of Shakespeare?**

**SLC:** Tarak-babu discussed the text in detail. He never referred to performances.

**Was there any performance of Shakespeare at the institution?**

**DLC:** We didn’t have performances at the institution. We used to go and see the Kendalls and UtpalDutt perform. Utpal was my age. He studied at St. Xavier’s College.

**SLC:** Performances started in Jadavpur after Professor Subodh Sengupta became the Head of theDepartment. I myself directed Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure etc with Debabrata-babu. I had a lot of trouble finding a girl for Measure for Measure. Debabrata-babu was a fantastic actor! These were staged at Gandhi Bhavan. I had thought of doing Duchess of Malfi with Ranjabati.

**What differences have you noticed between Shakespeare teaching in your country and abroad?**

**DLC:** Here it was very information oriented. Studying abroad was more about thinking on one’s own.

**SLC:** When I went to Leeds in 1961, Professor G. Wilson Knight was still teaching. We had tutorials,not classes. He opened up the theatrical aspect. That was the first time I realized that what we were reading was drama. We were not supposed to look at it only as a text.
