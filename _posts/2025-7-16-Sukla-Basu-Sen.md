How was Shakespeare taught?



Close reading of the plays, with attention to the poetry, to characterization, conflicts of interest, punning, word play, Shakespearean uses of words and phrases and metaphors and images.



What traits of any particular teacher impressed you most?



Prof Bhattacharya's oratory, close analysis of particular scenes and reifying the dramas of the play through elocution and deep sympathy shown towards characters in the plays.

Prof. Dasgupta used prevalent theories of literature, especially theories applicable to Renaissance drama in his readings of the plays. His lectures were not as interesting to the general students as professor Bhattacharya's was but the serious student sat completely mesmerized in his lectures. His expectations from the students' reception of the text were extremely high and students were hard put to fulfil these. Prof. Bhattacharya, on the other hand could reach out to all categories of students, anticipating as if by magic, each possible query from the listeners.



Prof. Sushil Mukhopadhay was a dedicated teacher and being a theatre person himself paid a lot of attention to the theatrical details. He was extremely thorough.



Prof. P.C.Ghosh was an extremely competent teacher who could arouse interest in his students.



Prof. Amalendu Basu taught us for a very short time and unfortunately we received very little from him.



Did the teacher enact the scenes in the class room?



Prof. Bhattacharya did sometimes but not the others.



Was the teacher very particular about pronunciation and accent?



Yes, all of them.



Were expletives and sexual references omitted?



No. Except in school, where we used the Verity Edition.



How far was the socio-historical context of plays discussed?



To a certain extent as the emphasis was always on internal poetics.



Were Shakespeare's contemporary dramatists given the same amount of importance in the classroom?



Not always, although Prof. Dipendu Chakraborty gave serious attention to Doctor Faustus in the class room.

Were students encouraged to think independently and challenge the teacher?



NO.



Editions and critical material prescribed and used:



Arden Shakespeare, Cambridge Edition, Folger Library Shakespeare were the edition encouraged to be used. As critical material, Shakespeare Survey and Shakespeare Quarterly volumes were widely encouraged.



Examination and question pattern:



Questions were set on the tragic experience of King Lear or the tragic consequences of the love between Antony and Cleopatra; on the philosophical concerns of King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra and Macbeth.



The questions were set on morality and social responsibilities in the tragedies and about comic word play love, romance, and comic plot in the Comedies.



Did the teacher refer to stage and film productions of Shakespeare?



Not necessarily, although Prof. Bhattacharya discussed stage production when I did my research on Comedies under him.



Whether the text was related to performance conventions.



Sometimes, not always.



Were there was any performance of Shakespeare at the institution?



Not while I was a student but there were several attempts at stage production both at college and university.



Account of classmates who later distinguished themselves as teachers, performers etc.:

Prof. Shirsendu Chakraborty, who has distinguished himself as a professor of 18th century English literature at Delhi University and has served as Tagore professor at the Shimla Institute of Advanced Studies.



Noticeable changes in Shakespeare pedagogy and student reaction over the decades:



Classes are much more interactive. Performance of Shakespearean texts in the original or in Bengali translation and adaptation regularly take place in a department like ours. Sometimes play readings are done on a significant scale so that students get to know the way the original play text sounded. Films on the texts, are sometimes multiple versions of these are shown to the students on a regular basis. Visits to theatre performances of the originals or translations and adaptations by any group/s are always encouraged. In the nineties, departmental students of Visvabharati were taken to Kolkata to see the performance of the Comedy of Errors by the Royal Shakespeare Company. We often arrange Shakespeare quizzes in an individual class or in the Department on Shakespeare Day.



Do you think that Shakespeare is an overrated author?



No.



How would you react to the present trend of de-glamorizing and de-canonizing Shakespeare?



I see no problem with this. I only wish that he were read more.



How would you react to the phenomenon of reading Shakespeare in a simplified language or in paraphrase, now popular among students in the West?-



In a world where students often consider texting language as the only language used in the class room and outside it, No Fear Shakespeare is perhaps an acceptable option. It is a fact that Shakespeare is read more in the original in the ex-colonies of the British. In the class room efforts should always be targeted at arousing interest in Shakespeare the dramatist, in the magic of his words, and the deep understanding of the psychology of the characters he created. Shakespeare can live both on the stage and in the classroom and it is time we concertedly made an effort to ensure this life.



Any suggestion about who else may be profitably interviewed for our project?



Dr. Annanya Dutta Gupta who is a Renaissance Scholar.
