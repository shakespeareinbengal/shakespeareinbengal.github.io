**Prof. Fakrul Alam**

University of Dhaka; East West University, Dhaka

(Interviewed by Sri Abhishek Sarkar via e-mail)

**Year of passing B.A. and M.A.?**

I passed my B.A. in 1973 and M.A. in 1974. I took my second M.A. in 1980.

**What were the institutions concerned.**

My B.A. and M.A. were from the University of Dhaka; my second M.A. was from Simon Fraser University. I subsequently completed my Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.

**When did your first encounter with Shakespeare take place (at school or college)?**

In school. This was the St. Joseph’s School, Dhaka.

**Could you name the Shakespeare texts on the college and university syllabi?**

We read 8 Shakespeare plays in total — A Midsummer Night’s Dream; As You Like it; Hamlet; King Lear; Othello; Measure for Measure: Henry IV, Part 1; Richard II; The Tempest.

**Who taught the texts in question?**

I can name Professors K.S. Murshed and Razia Khan Amin, both of the University of Dhaka.

**What techniques were used for teaching Shakespeare?**

The teachers basically practised close reading. They provided interpretations of the text and also some background information.

**Did the teachers maintain total gravity in class or cut jokes to enliven the reading experience?**

The teachers maintained total gravity in the classroom.

**Did the teacher enact the scenes in the class room?**

At times. That was of course not the usual practice.

**Was the teacher very particular about pronunciation and accent?**

Yes. They more or less tried to follow the received English pronunciation.

**Did the teacher discuss philology and prosody while reading Shakespeare?**

No. Philology and prosody were kept aside for a different paper.

**Were expletives and sexual references omitted?**

Yes. Politeness was strictly maintained in the classroom.

**How far was the socio-historical context of plays discussed?**

To some extent, the discussion was not very thorough. These were the days before the rise of New Historicism and Cultural Materialism.

**Were Shakespeare’s contemporary dramatists given the same amount of importance in the classroom?**

We were taught plays by Kyd, Marlowe, Jonson and Webster as well, but Shakespeare was held to be more important than these playwrights.

**Were students encouraged to think independently and challenge the teacher?**

Not really! There was not much interaction between teachers and students.

**Editions and critical material prescribed and used.**

Arden, Penguin and New Cambridge editions were prescribed in the class.

**Examination and question pattern.**

We had a 4 hour examination with essay type questions and reference-to-the-context type questions.

**Did the teacher refer to stage and film productions of Shakespeare?**

That was very rarely done. We did not have much access to international films back then.

**Was the text related to performance conventions?**

Not really. This is a recent development.

**Whether there was any performance of Shakespeare at the institution.**

No, but Doctor Faustus was performedat the University of Dhaka.

**Account of classmates who later distinguished themselves as teachers, performers etc.**

Professor Kaiser Haq of the University of Dhaka was my classmate.

**Noticeable changes in Shakespeare pedagogy and student reaction over the decades.**

Shakespeare teaching is now more performance oriented, and there is an increased scope for films to be shown in order to supplement classroom lectures.

**What differences have you noticed between Shakespeare teaching in your country and abroad?**

In North America, classrooms at the graduate level are all seminar-based rather than lecture-based.

**Did the teachers refer to authors in other languages (e.g. Homer, Goethe, Tagore) while discussing Shakespeare in the classroom?**

It has been a while and I can’t remember for sure, but it would be difficult for anyone one in Bangladesh to teach Shakespeare without mentioning Rabindranath, especially at the Bangladesh moment – which is when I was in the university. In fact, one of my teachers, Professor Murshed, led the movement against the Pakistani government in the sixties when it tried to ban Rabindranath.

Certainly, when I teach Shakespeare, Rabindranath comes into my lectures sooner or later.

**Is the present generation of students in Dhaka interested in Shakespeare, or are they more attracted to postmodernism and postcolonialism?**

Ever since students have been introduced to postmodernism and postcolonialism in Bangladesh, they have taken to it enthusiastically. But this hasn’t come in the way of their appreciation of Shakespeare.

**Do you think that Shakespeare is an overrated author?**

No way!

**How would you react to the present trend of de-glamorizing and de-canonizing Shakespeare?**

This too will pass!

**How would you react to the phenomenon of reading Shakespeare in a simplified language or in paraphrase, now popular among students in the West?**

No way! I do not approve of this trend at all. This takes the essence away from Shakespeare and leaves behind the bare skeleton.
