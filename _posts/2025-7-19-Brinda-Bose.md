**Where did you study for your B.A. and M.A. degrees?**

I studied for my B.A. at Presidency College, Kolkata, from 1982 to’85. My M.A. was from Oxford, from 1986 to ’88 and my Ph.D. from Boston University.

**When did your first encounter with Shakespeare take place?**

My introduction to Shakespeare was at school at Loreto House with Ms. Sood, who taught us Julius Caesar in class VIII. She made it very exciting for us. There was a lot of play reading in class. Shetaught us *The Merchant of Venice*, and along with the play readings there were explanations. Sarah Dasgupta taught us *Julius Caesar* for class IX and X. We got a lot of background information about the Globe theatre then. We all landed up loving the play and practically memorizing it and enacting it at the end of class VIII. It was a very intense engagement. It is a lively play and we didn’t feel intimidated by it at all. The plot was very easy to follow. While reading *Julius Caesar* we learnt about the historical sources like *Holinshed and Plutarch*, as it was a historical play, though we didn’t read them. There was a lot of discussion on language in Class IX and X, especially about the puns and the words that he coined and the etymological basis of words. We also talked about the idea of poetic language, symbolism, allegory and things like that. With Shakespeare in particular, that was an opening up of an entirely alien yet fascinating world of literature. We were asked not to read ahead, but to do it in class, through dramatic readings in class. Long speeches didn’t make much sense when we read it alone, but when you go back line by line with the teacher’s help and unpack it, peeling layers off the play everything becomes absolutely clear – and that stayed with me. It was this Shakespeare teaching in school that made me want to stay with literature. There were a lot of reference to context questions in school, in order to make us engage closely with the text, and all teachers would make us write longer answers, and insisted that we know every line very well. There were questions on language, interactions and the characters. They were very thorough in school.

In college we again had these line-by-line engagement with Shakespeare. *As You Like It* was taught by Sukanta Chaudhuri and Kajal Sengupta taught us *Macbeth*. Kajal-di was very textual and dramatic while Sukanta-da was erudite and scholarly, even explosive. I still remember how we came out blitzed from the classes. He taught what Shakespearean comedy was all about, the ideas behind the Renaissance, the notions of comedy versus tragedy in Shakespearean terms. He was very conceptual. It wasn’t play reading anymore. We learnt about the grandeur of tragedy from Kajal-di. It was an introduction to the hugely complex Renaissance world, genres of literature and that there was no one way of defining what a genre was all about. We really enjoyed engaging with the plays. At Oxford, there were two Shakespeare papers, where we had to study all the plays and sonnets. The entire breadth of the system was astounding. There is a lack of breadth in our M.A. system these days. The breadth of our reading was achieved at Oxford.

When I first started teaching, I taught *As You Like It*. Sukanta-da’s teaching stood me in good stead. I taught *Othello*. The value of reading closely struck me only after I got an idea of the entire genre. It was a wholly different experience at Oxford, and it would be best if both styles were put together.

With Sukanta-da teaching us *As You Like It*, I got a precious look into the world of the Renaissance. He taught us about the self-fashioning Renaissance Man. On the other hand, Kajal-di was a drama specialist (she taught Congreve as well), and gave us a theatrical insight into the age. She had a great deal to offer on the genre of drama and how interjections, and things like that were handled on stage.

Literary Theory and Literary Criticism were not as obviously employed in the undergrad classes. Supriya Chaudhuri took a special class on Literary Theory as it was not covered by the syllabus. Our teachers were well read, and were using theory to teach, but never sharply delineating the different ways of reading texts. We realized much later that Kajal-di’s views were Left-centric, so that was a fruitful way of doing it, instead of a blatant theory-oriented reading. We were also never made to feel overwhelmed at the jump from school to college. We amassed a lot of knowledge owing to so much of new matter opening up before us, but we never got overwhelmed by it.

**Were the teachers very particular about pronunciation?**

Sarah was a Christian married to a Dasgupta so she had good pronunciation, Kajal-di and Sukanta Chaudhuri had refined pronunciation, but they never made an issue of it. There was a diversity of pronunciations, but they never made an issue of it.

**Were the expletives and sexual references omitted?**

There were no omissions. Metaphors and sexual puns were explained to us. In school – not explicitly, but referred to.

**How far was the socio-historical context of the plays discussed?**

The socio-historical context was explained to us in fairly good detail in school and very well in college.

**Were Shakespeare’s contemporary dramatists given the same amount of importance?**

We had Marlowe. Same amount of time allotted, Sukanta-da would voluntarily do Renaissance background, and eventually Shakespeare got more time. There were also two Shakespearean plays. Shakespeare was central to Renaissance drama. Marlowe, many of us had not even heard of. In *Edward* the homosexuality aspect was wholly elided. This was unforgiveable at the undergraduate level. It was a wrong choice for a play, a major discrepancy on the syllabus. A case could have been made as to why *Edward II* should be chosen. It was almost taught distastefully. I did a long paper on Marlowe at Oxford and went back to *Edward II* and rethought all the things taught to us and was not happy at all. It didn’t do justice to Marlowe. The teaching did not give us a sense of the period. Marlowe seemed more exciting with Sukanta-da doing the history of the period with us.

**Were students encouraged to think independently and ask questions?**

Our school encouraged us to ask questions. Loreto was not oppressive, but all of us were in awe of Sarah, no one knew enough to challenge the teacher. The general atmosphere at Presidency was to engage with the text and the class, we depended on the teachers. Kajal-di in particular encouraged us to ask questions, but Sukanta-da was an awe-inspiring teacher. We were too overwhelmed doing the history part. During his textual analyses, one or two students might have challenged him, but I don’t remember clearly.

**What were the editions used for the Shakespeare texts?**

We used the Verity edition for *The Merchant of Venice* at school, but at the college level we used only the Arden edition.

**What was the question pattern like?**

We had reference-to-the-context questions, and long answers where we were expected to show extensive research. We covered the entire gamut of criticism, from A. C. Bradley to Greenblatt’s *Renaissance Self-Fashioning*. The idea of humanism became central around which you can understand the Renaissance. What we came away with from the Presidency years was a rich understanding of the Renaissance. Scholarship in drama – that was Kajal-di’s arena. We were never allowed to lose sight of the dramatic production. We were also taught about the complexities of literary genres, and that you cannot take terms like tragedy and comedy at face value, and that the socio-historical and philosophical approaches to genre changed over time.

**Did you watch any Shakespeare productions at that time?**

We saw some BCL productions. That was the time we got an idea of Kurosawa. The film society movement was also exploding then. No performances at Presidency.

**Do you think that Shakespeare is an overrated author?**

No, Shakespeare is not overrated. Well worth studying his plays. Very good as a pedagogical process in literary studies. Great way to enter the deeper end of literature. School and UG teaching of Shakespeare is really important to literary studies.

**How would you react to the present trend of de-glamourizing and de-canonizing Shakespeare?**

It’s fine to de-canonize Shakespeare. Canons need to be questioned. But the plays themselves are worthy of study and yield a great amount of literary value. However, the canon is a problematic construct. It should be questioned.

**How would you react to the phenomenon of reading Shakespeare in paraphrase or simplified form, now popular among students in the West?**

There is no point in reading a paraphrase at college or university, just like reading the Charles and Mary Lamb version.
