**Prof. Aloka Sarkar**

Formerly of Bijoy Krishna Girls’ College, Howrah

(Interviewed by Abhishek Sarkar)

**When did you pass the B.A. and M.A. examinations? And details of the institutions concerned.**

I completed B.A. (English) Honours (1967-68) from Wadia College, Pune in 1.5 years because I had done an intermediate course at St. Mary’s School in Pune. I did my M.A. much later from Jadavpur University between 1978-79.

**When did your first encounter with Shakespeare take place (at school or college)?**

I came from Pune so I had a different yardstick. Both in school and at the intermediate level the people who taught Shakespeare did a great job of dramatizing the plays. The reading was done entirely by students and the teachers merely commented on it.

**Which Shakespearean texts were included in the college and university syllabi? Who taught the texts in question? What techniques were used (e.g., close reading, lecture demonstration, group discussion, seminars etc) for teaching Shakespeare?**

I got married and had kids before I came to Jadavpur. Here, the pedagogy of Shakespeare was very different. The works were presented almost entirely like flat texts. We consumed the texts very passively, without any dramatizing. Even within this negative framework certain good things were taught. Professor Dinesh Chandra Biswas (DCB) was the only professor who managed to leave a mark on us. He also mentioned the influence of Taraknath Sen and how he had taught Shakespearean plays as performance texts. He mentioned how wherever in a play there was a line with two or three syllables at the end, it was always in iambic pentameter, implying that the actor was taking steps, as for example in the scene after Duncan’s murder. He made us very aware of such things in the text. He also told us to assess *Macbeth* in Joycean terms, setting up comparisons with Joyce’s concept of tragic pity and tragic fear in *The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*. By this time an anti-Bradley notion had set in. DCB told us to read Bradley cleverly. He was on the verge of leading us through theory. He asked us to read G. Wilson Knight and Shakespearean surveys and E.M.W. Tillyard’s *Elizabethan World Picture*. Though theory was not taught per se guidelines were given.

At the M.A. level DCB taught us *Twelfth Night* and *Winter’s Tale*, but this time things had changed, he went into great detail regarding stage and performance related sources. He taught us from various other sources as well, with a little bit of Marxist theory thrown in. Feminism had not come into being as yet, however there was something called the ‘woman’s perspective’. DCB was a professor who was willing to discuss a lot of things with his students that were conventionally outside the text. He taught *Twelfth Night* in a very interesting manner. Later *King Lear* was done by Professor Jagannath Chakraborty who gave a brilliant one-class lecture on its thematic and structural aspects. We had a tutorial with Kitty Datta, she did *King Lear* with us because we asked her to help us with its stylistic analysis. She also exposed us to the theory of structuralism and myth criticism, both being things she didn’t really believe in. She was very helpful in making us focus on the language of the play. Classroom teaching was extremely boring but Shakespeare was more than just the classroom. Sonnets were neglected but we did it ourselves. At the undergraduate level I had Sati-di, Kitty-di and Jashodhara-di who were all wonderful teachers.

I also did *Othello* in Alternative English, since I didn’t know Bengali. And in the B.A. we did *The Tempest, As You Like It and Macbeth*. DCB taught *Macbeth* whereas *As You Like it* was verypoorly taught by Pramati-di. In classes 8, 9, 10 and 11, we did *The Tempest* with a British nun, Sister Louisa who was a wonderful teacher and a great dramatist.

**What traits of any particular teacher impressed you most?**

Debabrata-babu was a really good professor but he was also a great actor. When he delivered the lines it really signified something and he bore a slight resemblance to Shakespeare himself. Other professors like Shishir-babu, Jashodhara-di and Sati-di were also excellent teachers.

**Did the teachers maintain total gravity in class or cut jokes to enliven the reading experience?**

The professors were amiable but they maintained a sense of decorum in the class.

**Did the teacher enact the scenes in the class room?**

There were no scenes enacted at Jadavpur University. Yet coming from a school where we were taught through enactment and dramatization of texts, Jadavpur was a disappointment. In Pune our class teachers in the middle and high school levels were so brilliant that each scene remained embedded in our minds for ages.

**Was the teacher very particular about pronunciation and accent?**

Since I had attended a Protestant school back in Pune we were mainly taught by British nuns and Anglo-Indian teachers who spoke fluent English. By class 8 we were well versed in English. At Jadavpur however, the delivery of the texts wasn’t good enough and there were a lot of mispronunciations.

**Did the teacher refer to literature in other languages while discussing Shakespeare? For example, would the teacher mention Dante, Kalidasa or Tagore while reading Shakespeare with the students?**

DCB often asked us to go and look at texts like *The Spanish Tragedy* because it would help us understand Shakespearean and Jacobean tragedies better.

**Were expletives and sexual references omitted?**

Sexual references were mostly deleted. DCB didn’t dwell on it and handled most of such references very professionally.

**How far was the socio-historical context of plays discussed?**

DCB made us read the textual history very well in order to identify with and understand the socio-historical aspects of the text. He was a very scholarly professor and paid special attention to background reading.

**Were Shakespeare’s contemporary dramatists given the same amount of importance in the classroom?**

Marlowe was also given a lot of importance, alongside Shakespeare. Our professors always asked us to read other plays to understand the different styles of writing during the Renaissance.

**Were   students   encouraged   to    think    independently   and    challenge   the     teacher?**

Not so much in the classroom but during tutorials DCB and Kitty-di were so welcoming and approachable that we were really enriched by their special attention.

**Which editions and what critical materials were prescribed and used?**

Arden was the ultimate edition, but it wasn’t available so there was an alternative edition by Mermaid. Those days books weren’t that expensive. The Case Book Series was also available in the library. Later Arden published concessional editions that were also prescribed in class. We used a plain text of Shakespeare. Verity was not prescribed because the professors thought that it would limit our understanding and interpretation of the texts. L.C. Knights, Wilson Knight and other historical resources were given importance. *20th Century Interpretations* was also an excellent text.

**What was the examination and question pattern like?**

We had very basic questions back then, either general character or scene-based questions. Today we can pose a whole array of other questions from political standpoints and feminine perspectives. It is much more diverse now, back then studying Shakespeare was limited to the text itself and some out-dated scholarly articles. We had both short and long questions. The short questions were mostly ‘locate and annotate’ questions and the longer ones were essay-type questions.

**Did the teacher refer to stage and film productions of Shakespeare?**

DCB didn’t talk about film productions but he made us aware that there were many ways to do *Macbeth*, encouraging us to look up Shakespearean Surveys. Very recently in fact I saw a production where a female actor plays a male character, showing just how much things have changed. Mihir-da who taught us Shelley’s poems, briefly mentioned some productions and films. He was very open to discussion. He was always available for clarifications as well. Shishir Chatterjee had specially recommended Mihir-da for external help. We were told about Kurosawa’s adaptation The Throne of Blood but there was no attempt to show it to us.

**Were the texts related to performance conventions?**

DCB did Shakespeare in conjunction with the Elizabethan stage history and spoke to us extensively about the Globe and the Blackfriars Theatre. He made us do things like ‘play-within-the-play’ and engaged in a wide range of studies covering performance conventions.

**Was there any performance of Shakespeare at the institution?**

Though the classroom pedagogy was dull, the students put up two brilliant productions during my stay at Jadavpur. One was *As You Like It* which was done by a mixture of staff and students and included two visiting professors from abroad as well. The other was *Measure For Measure* performed entirely by the students.

**What noticeable changes in Shakespeare pedagogy and student reaction have you noticed over the decades?**

There is definitely a change; today people ask more questions, there are several interpretations. I think this is a great change for it helps to bring about many other angles. But I will say that during our time the people really knew their texts and history unlike children today who don’t make the effort. I don’t think there is a loss of interest, it is just that the mediums have become less or more interesting now.

**What differences have you noticed between Shakespeare teaching in your country and abroad?**

I think it’s very difficult to really study Shakespeare without going abroad. One needs to have access to a number of brilliant libraries abroad. Infrastructure plays a big role in research work. This is where India falls short sometimes. Not all the universities are able to provide their research candidates with the right materials for successful work.

**How would you react to the present trend of de-glamorizing and de-canonizing Shakespeare?** 

By the time we did Shakespeare there had already been a reaction against Bradley and the de-canonization of Shakespeare had already begun. Our professors were very critical of Shakespeare’s work and never put it above any other literary genius’ work.

**How would you react to the phenomenon of reading Shakespeare in a simplified language or in paraphrase, now popular among students in the West?**

Students in our time read the text, even if the pedagogy was not good their reading habits were in place. The British Council has an English Study Circle where teachers are surprised that we read so much of Shakespeare. They prefer to avoid Shakespeare. I have heard about the No Fear Shakespeare series which is a section of Spark Notes. There was a funny incident where there was a student who wrote that Milton’s poetry was written on the left hand side and prose on the right hand side because it was given in that format on the website.
