***Prof. Anima Biswas***

*Formerly University of Burdwan*

*(Interviewed by Sri Arunava Banerjee)*

*Sunday,24,2019*

I do not feel I can answer you satisfactorily. I am not a great Shakespeare scholar. My Ph. D. was on **John Galsworthy** under **Bhabatosh Chatterjee**. I taught Shakespeare – the tragedies mainly. I was burdened with the teaching of his *tragedies*, *King Lear*, *Hamlet* and other plays. I have a great interest in Shakespeare though, and I will be a little autobiographical here. As a result of one misfortune after another, I lost many of my books, quite a few of which were annotated by me in the margins from multiple editions. I have plenty of books all over my house, but while looking for a Verity or while doing some work on it, I feel a sense of remorse that I have lost contact with books, that I have to take the help of my maid who is not educated, who doesn’t know what is a Verity edition or what is Lear. This is the problem I faced when you contacted me. I was in *Bombay* last year. I reiterate that I am not a great Shakespeare scholar, but still I have some papers, some publications, and I had to teach Shakespeare whenever the authorities felt the need for it, particularly for their distance education courses. I had to set question papers and so on. So, I supervised students on Shakespeare, at the M. Phil. and at the Ph. D. level. M. Phil. was more interesting, the title of the M. Phil. dissertation of one of my students was **‘Two Hamlets’**, the second one being **Stoppard’s Rosencrantz** and **Guildenstern** are Dead. Since I worked on modern drama I took an interest in this kind of analysis, and helped the student, and she has continued to do her Ph. D. under my joint supervision after my retirement.

***Could you tell us the dates and institutions concerned for your B.A. and M.A.?***

My year of passing B.A. and M.A. are **1965** and **1967**, from *Asansol Girls College* and from *Burdwan University respectively*.

***When did your first encounter with Shakespeare take place?***

I don’t have an extensive recollection of what texts were taught, but I vaguely remember that there must have been portions from Shakespeare’s plays at the school level. At the degree level, Shakespeare’s plays formed a major component for the students studying Honours, so I developed an interest. I have only vague memories of the texts from my school days. I developed an interest in Shakespeare from my college days, which continued through to the postgraduate level. Later on I passed and joined service and became a teacher, first at Asansol Girls’ College and then from there I joined *North Bengal University*, where **Amlan Dutta** was the Vice Chancellor. Next I joined Burdwan University, and from that university I completed my tenure and retired.

Who were the people who taught Shakespeare?

My debts of inheritance are to some teachers, not all of whom taught us Shakespeare. Sometimes they taught through seminar lectures and inspired us. My great debts of inheritance are to **Professor Bhabatosh Chatterjee**, my supervisor; who did not officially teach Shakespeare. His books are on *Keats* and *W.B. Yeats*, but I felt always that there was an influence of my teacher over me; he had inspired me in so many ways. Apart from that mention should be made of so many other teachers, **Professor Sadananda Chakraborty**, **Professor S.L. Bhattacharya**, **Professor Tirthankar Bose** (who is the son of Professor **Amalendu Bose**), **Professor Kalidas Bose**. These are some of the names of the people I feel indebted to, I should express my gratitude to them.

***How was Shakespeare taught?***

Apart from some variations on the introductions to Shakespeare by various teachers, the main approach to Shakespeare followed by most of these teachers was the academic analysis of the text. In some ways, **Professor Tirthankar Bose**, who went back to *Canada*, had always attempted to make us interpret Shakespeare in our own ways. So, some such exceptions were there. But the main approach was the academic one, there was no enactment of the scenes in the classroom.

***Were the teachers concerned about pronunciation and accent?***

We never felt so, but some teachers had the training or skill, as in the case of **Professor Tirthankar Bose** and **Professor Sadananda Chakraborty**, I think they had the skill, so we listened to them. There used to be complete silence when **Sadananda Chakraborty** went through the text, it was a kind of spell that he could spread, this was the kind of approach. As students we thought that this approach was the best one, but later when I joined the university and burdens were placed on me that included the teaching of *Lear* and *Murder in the Cathedral*, that was when I decided to write something for the students. So, I wrote a paper on Lear keeping in mind my students. There were other papers also, but it was on British Drama of the 20th century that I mostly focused on. Shakespeare was there too, no doubt. I loved to read and teach Shakespeare, I don’t know why.

***Were the sexual references and expletives omitted in the classroom?***

The texts which we used to read or were recommended for us, I think in some way or the other were bowdlerized. Verity was one, for example. In Verity, you will find a lot of difference, in the first scene itself. Shakespeare’s own words, the comments by *Gloucester* are removed, in Verity you don’t find them, but you find them in the Arden Shakespeare. The Arden Shakespeare was the recommended text for students. Now the New Cambridge and other editions are available and students make much use of that. So, in the texts which were recommended we did not observe such details. We were not particularly keen or conscious either. Now I feel that Verity or other editions had cut down some of the original passages, which were in some *sense indecent*, which were not fit to be read before ladies.

***How far was the socio-historical component discussed?***

The introductory component for any Shakespeare text requires a socio-historical context; every teacher had to fulfill this. There must be an introductory background lecture on the socio-political, moral, religious and cultural aspect of the text. We were fortunate in having that kind of training from our teachers.

***Were Shakespeare’s contemporary classmates given the same amount of importance in the classroom?***

Can geniuses be equated that way? Every genius or talent has his or her own sphere. So how can we use the word ‘same’? I think due recognition of each of Shakespeare’s contemporaries or due importance was given to them by the teachers. I myself taught **Marlowe’s** **Doctor Faustus** and other texts as well. We had *Edward II* on our syllabus at *Burdwan University*.

***Were students encouraged to think independently?***

Yes, I can assure you that students were always encouraged to think and write independently. It was a guideline. Students were encouraged to write independently in their own way and use their perception. It did not necessitate any kind of challenge to the teacher. The practice of challenging the teacher did not emerge.

***Which editions did you follow as a student?***

I always recommend Arden and New Cambridge, there are Penguin and other Shakespeare editions too. But as we teach at the M.A. level here, I always ask students to go to the library and check on the Variorum edition as well. I always ask them to read various editions to compare the various footnotes. I also asked my students to check Verity as he has a great contribution to the tradition of Shakespeare studies.

***Examination and question pattern?***

As a student, we had a written exam where essay type questions were set. It was not a semester system like it is now. Explanations were sought. At the M.A. level, a few years ago, the semester system was introduced. The students read so little now. How much time they get I don’t know but they learn so little. The Burdwan University syllabus was modeled on the *Calcutta University syllabus*. Later on, they had several optional papers in their second year. Now the original syllabus has been cut down, Shakespeare has also been cut down, so I don’t think there is any incentive for introducing the semester system. However I think that it is a good thing because it is a kind of a regulated system, following a schedule as regards the time of the exams. The results should also be out in proper time, enabling students to go ahead with their careers. But do they learn properly? I do not know, given the very little time that they get. For example, if there are short questions of five marks each, they will get 19 or 20 on 20, but if you ask them about the text, they will just say the text was not taught meticulously. Since we have the technology at Burdwan, the teacher prepares Power Point presentations and switches it on, the students watch and read it. The teacher explains or clarifies some points, some phrases, some incidents or some notes, and then the class is over. So what kind of teaching is this? There is no analysis of the text in that sense, it is a comment. They have doubts whether they will be able to finish the text so that is why this becomes an accepted process of teaching. Most teachers do Power Point presentations and thus the text is finished in no time. If the students have a problem they can meet the teachers in their chambers. Classroom teaching has become restricted. The students are not available for the classes, the teacher too is not available some of the time.

***Did the teacher refer to stage and film productions?***

Yes, as a part of the introductory lectures, the Elizabethan stage was discussed, but references to film productions were not usually made.

***Was the text related to performance conventions?***

No. One or two teachers might have referred to that. **Jyoti Bhattacharya** made a great impression reciting **‘Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow’** at a seminar. Great teachers often gave seminar lectures, and he had made a very good impression, reciting it the way a great actor could. Controlling his steps and movement, with a kind of profound thought – ‘Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow’… it was wonderful. This is a very commendable thing, bringing Shakespeare alive. If only all teachers could do that.

Whether there was any performance at the institutions…

Not during my tenure as a PG student in *Burdwan University*, but later on, when I joined the department as a teacher, coming from *North Bengal University,* I found that Shakespeare was being performed. The teachers who formed the group called **Shakespeare Society of Eastern India** comprising **Amitava Roy** and his actors and actresses were very competent and they presented **Twelfth Night** in a wonderful manner, at our *Burdwan University* Campus, probably **Tarabagh.**

Have you noticed any changes in pedagogy and student reaction over the decades?

Noticeable changes … the examination system has changed. My point is that the way I received a sort of impetus or inspiration from my teachers that continued and took me through the years has changed. I always felt like extending the areas or testing, looking for new areas, looking for new points of relevance, and points of interpretation, new insights. I have an interest in the recent developments.

Students are overburdened, they are at a transition point in society, the environment is not conducive to their hectic academic routine. They are running for tuitions, they don’t have the time to concentrate on their studies. They don’t get much help from the institution or the teachers. For that nobody is responsible. This is a sort of unrest. Students can only learn in a peaceful environment, and that is not available. Some students have the power, insight and talent to go through the burden of research and make a meaningful contribution to the teaching of Shakespeare or other authors. Only a few can contribute to the study, teaching or performance of Shakespeare. I don’t know why, I cannot chart the changes for you. I felt that I am not doing anything satisfactory after I have retired. I could have helped more, but my health and eyesight aren’t at their best.

***Do you think that Shakespeare is an overrated author?***

Not at all, some people overrated him, but I think that if he is overrated, he deserves to be overrated.

Shakespeare lives. Shakespeare is still relevant. That is why I think that he is not overrated.

***What do you think about the present trend of deglamourizing and decanonizing Shakespeare?***

I don’t feel very optimistic about this. I could ask you, what is the necessity of this trend or this shift? What purpose would it serve? Should Shakespeare be liberated from the canon? Would that be an improvement? I don’t understand the purpose. As for glamour, despite whatever a work of art has achieved, Shakespeare still remains … glamour is not like changing fashions.

***How do you react to the issue of reading Shakespeare in a simplified manner?***

A slogan was raised at Burdwan, as there was some kind of problem at the degree level colleges of our university… **‘Shakespeare is unteachable’**… I do not know who started it, even our colleagues at the university started repeating it. I came from North Bengal University, and the teacher who taught Lear, and another teacher who taught Murder in the Cathedral pushed it onto me, as it was ‘unteachable’. So what is the reason? Teachers found Shakespeare unteachable, and students also shared the same view, I was just surprised. Fortunately, Shakespeare was retained, some texts were changed but one or two were removed, I think. Have you ever heard of the slogan? They wanted to change the idiom and the syntax by removing him. I am reminded of that as you ask this question.
