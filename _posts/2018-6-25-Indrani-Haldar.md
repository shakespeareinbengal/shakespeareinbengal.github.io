**Prof. Indrani Haldar**

Formerly of Jadavpur University

(Interviewed by Dr. Paromita Chakravarti and Sri Abhishek Sarkar)

**When did you pass the B.A. and M.A. examinations? And the details of the institutions concerned.**

I passed B.A. in 1955 from Lady Brabourne College and M.A. in 1957 from Presidency College.

**When did your first encounter with Shakespeare take place (at school or college)?**

While Shakespeare was not part of the prescribed Matriculation syllabus, we read excerpts from Shakespeare’s plays and at an early stage, Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare.

**Which Shakespeare texts were a part of the college and university syllabi?**

Our college and university syllabi happened to be loaded with Shakespeare texts (as part of P.G., U.G.(Hons.), and General English courses). At the undergraduate level we read *Coriolanus, Richard II, Macbeth, The Winter’s Tale, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream* for General English.

At the postgraduate level, we had one full paper (100 marks) on Shakespeare, the first half of which was devoted to a special study of Shakespeare’s life and times, the Shakespearean stage, publication-history, quartos and folios, and Shakespearean criticism. The second half was given over to a close reading of Shakespeare texts, with special attention being paid to *Hamlet, Richard III, Antony and Cleopatra, and Julius Caesar*.

**Who taught the texts in question?**

Of the many teachers who taught us ‘Shakespeare’, I shall mention only two, the most remarkable ones, Professor Subodh Chandra Sengupta and Taraknath Sen.

**What techniques were used (e.g., close reading, lecture demonstration, group discussion, seminars etc) for teaching Shakespeare? What traits of any particular teacher impressed you most?**

Professor Sengupta gave us a sweeping but brilliant and comprehensive survey of the first section of the Shakespeare paper. He was very up-to-date, having kept in constant touch with the new developments in Shakespeare research and criticism which he passed on to us in a lucid, compact but precise style even though his manner of speaking was usually deadpan and undramatic, with occasional flares of wry humour.

Professor Sen taught us *Hamlet* in a special class he took at Presidency (in a cubicle inside the library). While he was extremely academic and scholarly in his approach, exploring possible meanings and references, he also made the play come alive for us in all its ramifications, problems and doubts. He kept us in a state of constant and prolonged attention even as he dwelt at length on the many meanings of a single word or phrase.

**Was the teacher very particular about pronunciation and accent?**

Yes, Tarak-babu made us aware of the multiple nuances and significations of words and how they made the text flexible.

Both Subodh-babu and Tarak-babu were great scholars and while their pronunciations might not have been Oxonian, yet they kept us absolutely spellbound. Both were also dedicated teachers, concerned about their students. Apart from these two great teachers, Professor P.C. Ghosh at Calcutta University was a good-humoured teacher, though somewhat dramatic in his reading of Shakespeare texts.

**Did the teacher discuss philology and prosody while reading Shakespeare? Professor Sen delved into the origin and meanings of certain keywords.
Did the teacher refer to literature in other languages while discussing Shakespeare? For example, would the teacher mention Dante, Kalidasa or Tagore while reading Shakespeare with the students?**

Yes, Professor Sen did refer to other dramatists or texts, mostly Western or Classical ones. Subodh-babu was the one who referred to Indian texts, though rarely.

**Were expletives and sexual references omitted?**

No, texts were not bowdlerized and expletives and sexual references were not omitted.

**How far was the socio-historical context of plays discussed?**

Yes, the socio-historical context was discussed to some extent, and wherever it was absolutely necessary.

**Were Shakespeare’s contemporary dramatists given the same amount of importance in the classroom?**

Well, we had a separate paper for them but Shakespeare dwelt in solitary splendour.

**Were students encouraged to think independently and challenge the teacher?**

Yes, but we were too overawed by our teachers. Professor Sengupta was catholic in his approach but Tarak-babu did not like any controversy.

**Which editions and what critical material were prescribed and used?**

Tarak-babu stood heavily for the Arden edition which we usually bought second-hand from College Street. Subodh-babu gave us a brief but good reading list.

**Did the teacher refer to stage and film productions of Shakespeare?**

I remember Tarak-babu’s references to Lawrence Olivier’s cinema-version of *Hamlet* even though he totally disagreed with the actor’s over-insinuating interpretation of the character’s motives and actions.

**Were the texts related to performance conventions?**

Yes, especially when Tarak-babu read the player-scene in Hamlet with us.

**Whether there was any performance of Shakespeare at the institution?**

At Lady Brabourne College Geoffrey Kendall’s company Shakespeareana performed The Merchant of

Venice (with Utpal Dutt as Bassanio and Jennifer Kendall-Kapoor as Portia), *Macbeth* and *A Midsummer

Night’s* Dream for us.

**What differences have you noticed between Shakespeare teaching in your country and abroad?**

I did not study Shakespeare abroad and so I am not in a position to answer this question.

**Do you think that Shakespeare is an overrated author?**

Certainly not.

**How would you react to the phenomenon of reading Shakespeare in a simplified language or in paraphrase, now popular among students in the West?**

Almost all of Shakespeare is lost in simplified and paraphrased versions.
