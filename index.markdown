As one of the earliest regions to have been exposed to colonial education and Shakespeare, Bengal has a long history of engagement with the Shakespeare. The “Shakespeare in Bengal” archive focuses on contemporary Bengali negotiations with Shakespeare, particularly the rich corpus of performances, both on stage and film, as well as the pedagogic traditions and critical engagements with the Shakespearean canon from the nineteenth century onwards. The project started in 2011, under UGC CAS (Phase II), at the Department of English, Jadavpur University, and since then we have managed to build a substantial archive, with the help of School of Cultural Texts and Records. We have collected and digitized material from institutions and libraries scattered across Calcutta and Bengal. Our work has been internationally recognized and the Folger Shakespeare Library has approached the Department to propose hosting some of this material on Miranda, the digital platform of their “Global Shakespeares” project.
